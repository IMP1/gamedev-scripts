                    This is not a translation library. This will not do translations for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, this library will hopefully enable you to add translations further down the line (when you're done making the game), without having to change your code at all, with as little impact on the way you develop your games as possible.

                    Sweet nothings is designed to have minimal impact on your coding.

                    <h2>Setup</h2>
                    <p>No setup is required, but to use Sweet Nothings, a target language must be selected. I recommend, until later in the development, having the target language be whatever your native language is. You can also load translation files up front if you want.</p>
                    <p>To set the language, use <code class="language-lua">sweet_nothing.set_lanauge("en-GB")</code> and to load a lanauge's translations into memory, but not set it, use <code class="language-lua">sweet_nothing.load_lanauge("en-GB")</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>I use language codes ("en-GB", "fr", etc.) throughout this documention, but they're not necessary. You can use whatever your want, so long as they're unique strings for each lanauge, and you know which string matches which language.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Internationalisation</h2>
                    <p>There are two ways to use Sweet Nothing's internationalisation. The simplest is to translate the literal string into whichever language is set when the code is run. If you are using a GUI library, however, or something that keeps some state and holds the text in, then you might want this text to change if the language changes. In which case, you can either use the first solution and translate it when it is shown to the user, or you can use Deferred Localisation, which will return a lua table/object which will be translated when tostring is called on it.</p>
                    <pre>
<code class="language-lua">local T = sweet_nothings.localise
function love.draw()
    love.graphics.print(T"hello world", 0, 0)
end
</code>
                    </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Localisation</h2>
                    <p>You can set Sweet Nothings to add any missing localisations, and/or create missing language files. These language files are simply key/value pairs of the original language strings to target language strings.</p>
